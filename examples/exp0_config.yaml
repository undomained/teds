# =============================================================================
# 
#  Current version of the Tango E2E simulator can handle the following profiles
#   1.  individual_spectra: In this case only one single spectrum is processed. The IM 
#       and L1 processor cannot be used in this case but are replaced by the simplified moduel siml1.
#   2.  single_swath: This profile acounts for a single swath and a homogenous 
#       reference scene. It is meant to test the IM and the L1 processor
#   3.  S2_microHH: Same as S2_hom_atm but for microHH CO2 plume simulations
